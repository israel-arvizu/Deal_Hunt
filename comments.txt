Not here to inflict pain on others I am unapologetic for living the way it matter To my heart everything sits right when i listen to my hunch Got my stepping stone got my stepping stone

In questi anni sono risorto prima mi senrivo morto come se stessi giocando la mia stessa vita all 8 ma ora son cambiato piu deciso che mai a spaccare deciso piu che mai a fatturare deciso piu che mai a flexare

Siamo cartivi ragazzi nei bei quartieri quelli da cui scappavi appena vedevi quelli veri che nn tdadiscono ne subiscono ma si colpiscono e quando lo facciamo ne risenti tu e i tuoi denti

Dios las palabras

Bro.. is it me, or yesterday it was à différent instrumental. Same title, but it seems like its overwritten or something.

Don't dwell on the past, it only brings tears. Don't think too much about the future, it only brings fear. Living in the present with a smile on your face like a child will bring you joy. Wish those who read this comment will always be happy and beautiful

I don't want much for my birthday. I just want the person reading this to be healthy, happy and loved. Wishing you a good day!

to anyone who reads this comment: imagine a warm day where you're looking out the window and sipping on tea or coffee, watching the birds fly by and trees and grass dance to the wind. you sit there for hours just letting the day fly by without a worry or fear in mind and your plants reach for the sunlight trying to grow and bloom into something beautiful. and you start to think," life is good."

You know, i was haveing the worse day today and came across this music! When i started reading all of y'alls commits, i realized that if all of you have such good hearts, a sunny disposition, and are supportive to people you dont even know, then i need to follow all of you!  My day is better because you all! Thank you for being wonderful!

This makes me so calm when me and my sister fight 💕

I'll be moving to another country in less than a month and now I'm sitting in my room, drawing, watching the sunset while listening to chill lofi music. I'll leave a comment here to remind me of this peaceful and slightly melancholic moment.

This music is so brilliant, beautiful, smooth & uplifting! Also, as always, the visual artwork is incredibly detailed and magnificent. Thank you, once again, Chillhop channel. 🌞❤️☺️
